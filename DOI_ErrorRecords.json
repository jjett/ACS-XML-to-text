The discovery detailed in this paper is an experimental validation of a problem that everyone knew would crop up eventually in synthetic biology: while many biological parts can be approximated as discrete, composable units, the fact is that biology is a lot more messy than we like to admit.

        "description": "FK506 is a clinically relevant drug that acts as an immunosuppressant. The bacterial natural product is assembled by the polyketide synthase (PKS) FkbA-C and nonribosomal peptide synthetase FkbP enzyme complex.                                                                                                   Streptomyces are a rich source of pharmaceutical compounds; defined biochemical pathways enable these bacteria to convert common cellular intermediates, such as sugars and fatty acids, into secondary metabolites including antibiotics. The identification and characterization of secondary metabolic gene clusters is essential for the elucidation of the mechanism of secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

The most reliable methods, thus far, to ensure that a modified unit is inserted into the desired position in the ON sequence are chemical methods using the corresponding phosphoramidite units.                                                                                The optimization of genetic circuits and metabolic pathways often involves the construction of various iterations of the same construct or the use of directed evolution to achieve the desired function. An alternative approach, involving a method that randomizes individual parts in the same assembly reaction could be used for optimization by allowing for the ability to screen large numbers of individual clones expressing randomized circuits or pathways for optimal function.                                                                                Engineered strains for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications often express foreign proteins that reduce cellular fitness.",

        "abstract": "While cloning methods and DNA synthesis have rapidly evolved in recent years, there remain two drawbacks with current techniques: almost all cloning techniques require overhangs to be introduced during a PCR reaction and the introduction of medium-sized de novo DNA sequences (90\u2013300 base pairs) during cloning is either expensive or requires multiple steps.                                                                                A major limitation in the field of synthetic biology is the DNA maximum assembly size imposed by the currently available technologies. This constraint complicates the de novo synthesis of most bacterial genomes, including that of E. coli                                                                                                High-frequency oligonucleotide-directed recombination engineering, or recombineering, has enabled the rapid modification of several prokaryotic genomes to date.                                                                                In conventional methods for yeast mating-type conversion, the two different yeast mating-types generated from a parental strain can mate with each other in a process referred to as autopolyploidization. This, however, makes it difficult to isolate target cells of the desired mating-type and impedes subsequent crossbreeding for yeast genetic engineering purposes.                                                                                Since its inception, the field of synthetic biology has been rapidly growing, generating methodologies that have made possible the engineering of complex synthetic gene networks in bacteria. This new engineering framework has been harnessed to facilitate the creation of novel cellular functions and behaviors, in an effort to address real-world medical and environmental challenges.

        "description": "While cloning methods and DNA synthesis have rapidly evolved in recent years, there remain two drawbacks with current techniques: almost all cloning techniques require overhangs to be introduced during a PCR reaction and the introduction of medium-sized de novo DNA sequences (90\u2013300 base pairs) during cloning is either expensive or requires multiple steps.                                                                                A major limitation in the field of synthetic biology is the DNA maximum assembly size imposed by the currently available technologies. This constraint complicates the de novo synthesis of most bacterial genomes, including that of E. coli                                                                                                High-frequency oligonucleotide-directed recombination engineering, or recombineering, has enabled the rapid modification of several prokaryotic genomes to date.                                                                                In conventional methods for yeast mating-type conversion, the two different yeast mating-types generated from a parental strain can mate with each other in a process referred to as autopolyploidization. This, however, makes it difficult to isolate target cells of the desired mating-type and impedes subsequent crossbreeding for yeast genetic engineering purposes.                                                                                Since its inception, the field of synthetic biology has been rapidly growing, generating methodologies that have made possible the engineering of complex synthetic gene networks in bacteria. This new engineering framework has been harnessed to facilitate the creation of novel cellular functions and behaviors, in an effort to address real-world medical and environmental challenges.

However, human artificial chromosome (HAC)-based vectors now provide an alternate mechanism of gene delivery and expression with unlimited cloning capacity.                                                                                Assembly of DNA parts into DNA constructs is a foundational technology in the emerging field of synthetic biology. An efficient DNA assembly method is essential for high-throughput, automated DNA assembly in biofabrication facilities.                                                                                The bacterium Escherichia coli remains one of the most widely used hosts for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications due to its well-established genetics and robust systems for making heterologous proteins in the cytoplasmic and periplasmic compartments.",

My graduate research is devoted to the prediction of the effect of amino acid substitutions on protein function. During my doctoral studies in Loschmidt laboratories, I participated in the development of a general methodology for assessing the deleteriousness of protein mutations.                             My research is focused on examining the causes of physiological burden in E. coli when cells are transformed with foreign genetic devices, in order to understand how to design better synthetic systems for useful purposes. To understand this process in detail, it is useful to separate the contributions to gene expression that transcription and translation make.                             My doctoral work has been focused on rational engineering of synthetic metabolic pathway for biodegradation of toxic anthropogenic pollutant 1,2,3-trichloropropane.

My research interests combine enzyme discovery and engineering for biocatalysis with R&D on new expression systems and technologies. A core interest is on engineered and synthetic promoters for yeast expression systems, mainly Pichia pastoris.                             I am broadly interested in how natural and engineered complex systems generate useful functions and the ways that they adapt and evolve to meet new challenges.

My research focused on theoretical study of dynamic biological systems such as gene regulatory networks. After finishing my Ph.D., I joined the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB) and started to fill the gap between theory and real biological systems by learning wet lab techniques.                             My research interests lie in biosynthesis, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. In this project, we identified the main bottlenecks of the synthetic pathway involved in transformation of toxic chemical 1,2,3-trichloropropane to the harmless product glycerol.                             My research interests are enzyme engineering and synthetic biology, especially applications of genetic circuits along with protein engineering for synthetic biology. In this work, we have developed the Genetic Enzyme Screening System (GESS) that enables the rapid mining of novel enzymes by flow cytometry techniques.                             My Ph.D. research is focused on the identification and characterization of new regulatory transcriptional elements in three different yeast species.

        "abstract": "Harnessing biological functions for practical applications requires the engineering of biological systems and their components. Although living systems can be adapted for new purposes, cell-free systems offer greater design flexibility by allowing the use of non-native molecules and conditions.                                                                                The application of microelectromechanical systems to chemistry and biochemistry allows various reactions to be performed in microscale compartments.                                                                                Despite the increasing popularity of the cell-free methodology in synthetic biology, almost no effort has been expended in deciphering the rules needed for assembling genetic devices that function in vitro; protein levels are usually modulated simply by titrating a DNA template.                                                                                Many studies have shown that membrane protein can be synthesized and integrated in the vesicle membrane using in vitro transcription\u2013translation systems. While studies until date have described protein synthesis on the outside of the vesicle, synthesis inside the vesicle has rarely been investigated.                                                                                Synthetic enzyme complexes, containing multiple cascade enzymes, are a powerful tool in synthetic biology research. These complexes can be constructed by gene fusion, coimmobilization, coentrapment and scaffold-mediated assembly.                                                                                Existing bioconjugation methods using natural amino acids lack precision due to the presence of multiple surface-exposed copies of modifiable amino acids, such as lysines and cysteines, on most proteins.

In conventional engineering, each part of an instrument to be designed is assembled and tested with multiple cycles of prototyping in a simplified environment. However, for synthetic genetic circuits the norm has been to assemble and test purely in the end environment, which takes several days to weeks.                                                                                Cell-free systems are being used increasingly for the synthesis of both proteins and small molecules. While in vitro transcription and translation reactions until date have been primarily used for the production of single proteins, Lu and Ellington now demonstrate the possibility of coupled reactions.

        "description": "Harnessing biological functions for practical applications requires the engineering of biological systems and their components. Although living systems can be adapted for new purposes, cell-free systems offer greater design flexibility by allowing the use of non-native molecules and conditions.                                                                                The application of microelectromechanical systems to chemistry and biochemistry allows various reactions to be performed in microscale compartments.                                                                                Despite the increasing popularity of the cell-free methodology in synthetic biology, almost no effort has been expended in deciphering the rules needed for assembling genetic devices that function in vitro; protein levels are usually modulated simply by titrating a DNA template.                                                                                Many studies have shown that membrane protein can be synthesized and integrated in the vesicle membrane using in vitro transcription\u2013translation systems. While studies until date have described protein synthesis on the outside of the vesicle, synthesis inside the vesicle has rarely been investigated.

My research interests are mainly in developing synthetic biology technologies and applying them to unsolved questions/problems in biology and health. I cofounded SynVaccine, a synthetic biology vaccine development company on the basis of some of these technologies.                             This work is an output of my postdoc in the ICOS research group on the EU-funded project CADMAD. My scientific career has mostly focused on writing software assisting the design and analysis of biological experiments. In my current position I support the macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX) beamlines of the U.K.\u2019s national synchrotron.                             My scientific interests reside in applications of synthetic biology, microbial and mammalian systems (specifically for medical purposes), systems biology, gene therapy, and cancer biology. In this paper, we present a synthetic gene network architecture that operates as a biological decoder in human cells, converting 2 inputs to 4 outputs.                             I am interested in the algorithmic foundations for computational synthetic biology. In particular, I work toward an integrated computer-aided design (CAD) tool for automated synthetic circuit design. An integral challenge in synthetic circuit design is the selection of optimal parts to populate a given circuit topology, so that the resulting circuit behavior best approximates the desired one.                             My Ph.D. work involved developing a new class of synthetic biochemical systems as a test bed for gene regulatory networks. Several interesting dynamical systems were thus obtained including bistable switches and oscillators. In recent works, we introduce control-theoretic tools to explore ways to make the operation of synthetic biochemical oscillators more robust.                             My research interests concern (1) synthesis of programmable dynamic systems using basic biomolecular material and (2) application of system theoretic concepts in clinical genomics. In traditional engineering applications, dynamic systems such as the low-pass filters are used not only to reject noise and disturbance but also to eliminate the steady-state errors incurred in regulation and tracking.                             I am interested in combining mathematical and computer science methods in order to tackle biological problems. In this work, we present a methodology that uses metabolic models in order to extend the metabolic capability of different organisms.                             My research is focused on computational and computer-aided design and manufacturing of DNA libraries. Biology and biotechnology research and development involves \u201cDNA programming\u201d, which is akin to computer programming. Researchers modify and combine DNA of interest in a programmatic way to uncover its function, improve its function, or to create new functions.                             I have a background in Computing Science and I am interested in interdisciplinary research, where algorithmic approach is used to solve problems from other disciplines. Most of the projects I have been involved insofar were related to Computational Biology.                             My research is focused on enabling the programming biological systems for robust, desirable behaviors and understanding the computation performed by living cells and organisms through the design and application of novel computational methods and tools.",

In my current position I support the macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MX) beamlines of the U.K.\u2019s national synchrotron.                             My scientific interests reside in applications of synthetic biology, microbial and mammalian systems (specifically for medical purposes), systems biology, gene therapy, and cancer biology. In this paper, we present a synthetic gene network architecture that operates as a biological decoder in human cells, converting 2 inputs to 4 outputs.                             I am interested in the algorithmic foundations for computational synthetic biology. In particular, I work toward an integrated computer-aided design (CAD) tool for automated synthetic circuit design. An integral challenge in synthetic circuit design is the selection of optimal parts to populate a given circuit topology, so that the resulting circuit behavior best approximates the desired one.                             My Ph.D. work involved developing a new class of synthetic biochemical systems as a test bed for gene regulatory networks. Several interesting dynamical systems were thus obtained including bistable switches and oscillators. In recent works, we introduce control-theoretic tools to explore ways to make the operation of synthetic biochemical oscillators more robust.                             My research interests concern (1) synthesis of programmable dynamic systems using basic biomolecular material and (2) application of system theoretic concepts in clinical genomics. In traditional engineering applications, dynamic systems such as the low-pass filters are used not only to reject noise and disturbance but also to eliminate the steady-state errors incurred in regulation and tracking.                             I am interested in combining mathematical and computer science methods in order to tackle biological problems. In this work, we present a methodology that uses metabolic models in order to extend the metabolic capability of different organisms.                             My research is focused on computational and computer-aided design and manufacturing of DNA libraries. Biology and biotechnology research and development involves \u201cDNA programming\u201d, which is akin to computer programming. Researchers modify and combine DNA of interest in a programmatic way to uncover its function, improve its function, or to create new functions.                             I have a background in Computing Science and I am interested in interdisciplinary research, where algorithmic approach is used to solve problems from other disciplines. Most of the projects I have been involved insofar were related to Computational Biology.                             My research is focused on enabling the programming biological systems for robust, desirable behaviors and understanding the computation performed by living cells and organisms through the design and application of novel computational methods and tools.",

        "abstract": "As the field of synthetic biology matures and biological engineers aim to construct increasingly large and complex biological systems, it will become vital that design tools are available to make the design process as simple and reliable as possible.                                                                                Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria to infect plant species by binding to specific DNA sequences and activating the expression of genes. Considering the highly modular nature of TALEs and the ease of constructing these proteins, this technology can have important implications for synthetic biology.                                                                                Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are modular DNA binding proteins that can be rapidly designed and constructed to target any DNA sequences.                                                                                In order to understand proteins and their function/role in a cell\u2019s life, it is important to be able to control their function spatially and temporally. The best way to gain spatial and temporal control is via light. Efforts have been made to address this challenge, mainly by direct manipulation of the active site of the protein.                                                                                Intracellular calcium is a secondary messenger that plays a role in slew of biological processes, including transduction of survival signals, muscle contraction, and synaptic transmission. Previous work has described protein sensors for the real time imaging of intracellular calcium. However, a synthetic transcription factor that responds to intracellular calcium signals would enable the analysis of cellular events at the single-cell level.                                                                                One of the goals of synthetic biology is to \u201cimprove the process of genetic engineering\u201d. Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are giant multienzymes that carry out sequential couplings of amino acids to generate linear or cyclic peptides.                                                                                While natural products derived from microbes are an important source of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, their structural complexity makes chemical synthesis challenging. An additional challenge is the optimization of the pharmaceutical properties of these natural products, often via medicinal chemistry or biosynthetic engineering, for their desired applications.                                                                                Isoprenoids are one of the largest structurally varied groups of natural products.

Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria to infect plant species by binding to specific DNA sequences and activating the expression of genes. Considering the highly modular nature of TALEs and the ease of constructing these proteins, this technology can have important implications for synthetic biology.                                                                                Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are modular DNA binding proteins that can be rapidly designed and constructed to target any DNA sequences.                                                                                In order to understand proteins and their function/role in a cell\u2019s life, it is important to be able to control their function spatially and temporally. The best way to gain spatial and temporal control is via light. Efforts have been made to address this challenge, mainly by direct manipulation of the active site of the protein.                                                                                Intracellular calcium is a secondary messenger that plays a role in slew of biological processes, including transduction of survival signals, muscle contraction, and synaptic transmission. Previous work has described protein sensors for the real time imaging of intracellular calcium. However, a synthetic transcription factor that responds to intracellular calcium signals would enable the analysis of cellular events at the single-cell level.                                                                                One of the goals of synthetic biology is to \u201cimprove the process of genetic engineering\u201d. Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are giant multienzymes that carry out sequential couplings of amino acids to generate linear or cyclic peptides.                                                                                While natural products derived from microbes are an important source of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, their structural complexity makes chemical synthesis challenging. An additional challenge is the optimization of the pharmaceutical properties of these natural products, often via medicinal chemistry or biosynthetic engineering, for their desired applications.                                                                                Isoprenoids are one of the largest structurally varied groups of natural products. They play vital roles in plant metabolism and are synthesized by both, the mevalonate pathway and the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway.",

        "abstract": "Biochemical noise causes isogenic cells to reach different enzyme expression levels, potentially translating into large flux variability across cell cultures. Despite these considerations, the effect of noise remains overlooked in the design of genetic circuits for metabolic engineering.                                                                                The ability to engineer metabolic biosynthetic pathways has allowed for the microbial production of several useful chemicals. While metabolic imbalances often limit productivity and yield, synthetic regulatory circuits have been shown to be able to balance engineered pathways and, thus, increase productivity.                                                                                Titratable systems are powerful tools for programming genetic circuits and optimizing enzyme levels in metabolic pathways. Native sugar utilization pathways offer built-in titratable systems, although these pathways can exhibit undesirable responses such as bimodality or switch-like behavior.                                                                                Engineered metabolic pathways can be augmented with dynamic regulatory controllers to increase production titers by minimizing toxicity and helping cells maintain homeostasis.                                                                                One of the challenges of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology is the precise control of cellular metabolism.                                                                                Implementing reliable feedback and control in engineered circuits remains a challenge in the field of synthetic biology. While positive and negative feedback loops are commonplace in natural biological networks, synthetic circuits depend primarily on library-based screening to achieve optimal expression levels.                                                                                                   Ralstonia eutropha H16, a Gram-negative, facultative lithoautotrophic bacterium, is an organism of biotechnological importance. While recent metabolic engineering work has demonstrated the production of biofuels in R. eutropha, more advanced work requires tools such as a controllable gene expression system.                                                                                Ribosomal peptide natural products (RiPPs) comprise one of the largest groups of bioactive natural products. These peptides are compelling because they can be synthesized via a simple ribosomal mechanism but possess key drug properties due to extensive posttranslational processing.",

While metabolic imbalances often limit productivity and yield, synthetic regulatory circuits have been shown to be able to balance engineered pathways and, thus, increase productivity.                                                                                Titratable systems are powerful tools for programming genetic circuits and optimizing enzyme levels in metabolic pathways. Native sugar utilization pathways offer built-in titratable systems, although these pathways can exhibit undesirable responses such as bimodality or switch-like behavior.                                                                                Engineered metabolic pathways can be augmented with dynamic regulatory controllers to increase production titers by minimizing toxicity and helping cells maintain homeostasis.                                                                                One of the challenges of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology is the precise control of cellular metabolism.                                                                                Implementing reliable feedback and control in engineered circuits remains a challenge in the field of synthetic biology. While positive and negative feedback loops are commonplace in natural biological networks, synthetic circuits depend primarily on library-based screening to achieve optimal expression levels.                                                                                                   Ralstonia eutropha H16, a Gram-negative, facultative lithoautotrophic bacterium, is an organism of biotechnological importance. While recent metabolic engineering work has demonstrated the production of biofuels in R. eutropha, more advanced work requires tools such as a controllable gene expression system.                                                                                Ribosomal peptide natural products (RiPPs) comprise one of the largest groups of bioactive natural products. These peptides are compelling because they can be synthesized via a simple ribosomal mechanism but possess key drug properties due to extensive posttranslational processing.",

One possible solution is the biosynthetic production of next generation fuels.                                                                                In the effort toward rational design of micro-organisms for use in biotechnological and clinical applications, the ability to program the adhesion properties of engineered micro-organisms is crucial.                                                                                                   In vitro ribosome construction could enable studies of ribosome assembly and function, provide a route toward constructing minimal cells, and permit the construction of ribosomal variants with new functions. Despite tremendous interest in making ribosomes in vitro, current construction efforts are limited.                                                                                One aspect of synthetic biology deals with the assembling of unnatural parts to create systems that reproduce natural behaviors of biology, including coding, replication and evolution.",

While they remain invaluable for the discovery of these natural products and the engineering of the biosynthetic pathways that produce them, the genetic manipulation of these bacteria is often time-consuming and labor intensive.                                                                                Combinatorial design is emerging as one potential design paradigm for synthetic biology. The ability to combine individual libraries of biological parts to create designs promises to be a powerful approach since relatively small libraries can encode many possible designs.",

        "abstract": "One of synthetic biology\u2019s most ambitious ideas is to program complex multicellular behaviors, like cells that differentiate synthetically, or split up a problem among themselves.                             I\u2019m currently interested in understanding how bacteria make natural products that have medicinal applications, the design rules behind natural products biosynthesis, and exploring ways to use this understanding with synthetic biology to develop new medicines.                             My research revolves around the relationship between information and self-assembly in biological systems.                             I am interested in re-engineering the stress response and developmental pathways in plants to create agriculturally beneficial traits, such as salt adaptation or pest-triggered defense mechanisms.                             My research uses the in vitro all E.\u00a0coli transcription\u2013translation system to construct and model gene circuits with interesting dynamical behaviors and to understand self-assembly processes.                             We\u2019ve built incredible tools for manipulating cellular logic through signaling and nucleic acid circuits, but so far have not explored the full potential of manipulating cell morphology and behavior with motive forces.                             The goal of my research is to understand how bacteriophages and viruses self-assemble to their infectious, functional form.                             My PhD work has thus far focused on developing genetic tools to rapidly and precisely engineer the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.

        "description": "One of synthetic biology\u2019s most ambitious ideas is to program complex multicellular behaviors, like cells that differentiate synthetically, or split up a problem among themselves.                             I\u2019m currently interested in understanding how bacteria make natural products that have medicinal applications, the design rules behind natural products biosynthesis, and exploring ways to use this understanding with synthetic biology to develop new medicines.                             My research revolves around the relationship between information and self-assembly in biological systems.                             I am interested in re-engineering the stress response and developmental pathways in plants to create agriculturally beneficial traits, such as salt adaptation or pest-triggered defense mechanisms.                             My research uses the in vitro all E.\u00a0coli transcription\u2013translation system to construct and model gene circuits with interesting dynamical behaviors and to understand self-assembly processes.                             We\u2019ve built incredible tools for manipulating cellular logic through signaling and nucleic acid circuits, but so far have not explored the full potential of manipulating cell morphology and behavior with motive forces.                             The goal of my research is to understand how bacteriophages and viruses self-assemble to their infectious, functional form.

I am interested in understanding and manipulating the genetic determinants of microbial fitness in changeable environments like the soil, water and animal environments.                             My research included the effect of cellular resources allocation on the dynamics of translation in Escherichia coli.                             I believe that rationally engineering bacterial genomes will open doors for a broad range of novel biotechnology applications, as well as help us better understand basic cellular functions.                             My scientific interests are focused on the engineering of enzymes and microbial cell factories for a wide range of industrial applications and the need to do this in a sustainable, more predictable, time and cost efficient manner.                             I believe that time and resources are the only factors limiting scientific progress.                             My research is focused in finding solutions to the toxicity generated by the accumulation of chemicals in bacterial cell factories.                             My research is focused on reverse-engineering natural gene networks involved in bacterial decision-making, with an emphasis on dynamics.                             My research focuses on developing mathematical models and population dynamics algorithms to study how nongenetic phenotypic variability enhances antimicrobial drug resistance.                             Regulating gene expression noise with transcriptional gene circuits is has been on the minds of synthetic biologists.                             The introduction of the highly efficient CRISPR/Cas tool for filamentous fungi is a major step forward in the maturation of the genetic toolbox for these organisms.                             In my Master thesis, I studied the microbial diversity and microenvironmental conditions in the rhizosphere of seagrasses.                             My research is focused on the chemical synthesis of DNA base pairs that will recognize each other through hydrogen bonds in a manner similar to natural bases (A, C, G, T) but with altered hydrogen bonding patterns.                             I am interested in creating technologies that empower researchers to transition synthetic biology from the lab to real world applications with ease.                             My graduate work focused on using a bacterial system to identify an essential enzyme for human vitamin B12 metabolism.                             My Ph.D. research was focused on the engineering of yeast cell factories for efficient production of fuels and chemicals via enhanced supply of precursor metabolites, especially acetyl-CoA.                             I have been working on many aspects of methanogenic archaea, including their physiology and ecology, since my doctoral studies.                             I am broadly interested in engineering tools and applying them to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of complex cellular processes.                             My research interests are centered on using synthetic biology approach to study DNA damage repair pathways in eukaryotes, species bias in their functioning, and its relevance to genome modification and human cancers.                             The main focus of my research is within the fields of metabolic engineering, systems and synthetic biology.                             Filamentous naturally produce many interesting compounds and contain a large number of secondary metabolite encoding genes that are not expressed under laboratory conditions.                             My scientific interest focuses on biomedical research.

Natural products discovery programs have traditionally relied on the screening of culture broth extracts derived from randomly cultured bacteria to identify new biologically active metabolites.                                                                                The PURE system allows bacterial transcription and translation in a minimal reaction mix, which is composed of purified components.",

        "description": "My undergraduate research was focused on using cell-free metabolic engineering for the development of biosynthetic pathways, using the pathway fromglucose to mevalonate as a model.                             I am interested in using synthetic biology to improve the performance of photosynthetic organisms and enhance their ability to synthesize useful compounds.                             My Ph.D. research is focused on utilizing transcriptional interference (TI) mechanisms to create higher-order genetic switches with a reduced DNA footprint burden.                             My graduate work has been focused developing a generalized method for building protein based switches and sensors that can be modulated by small molecules.                             I am generally interested in using a combination of computational modeling and functional analysis to aid in protein design and drug discovery efforts.                             My research is focused on developing new methods for prototyping biosynethic pathways.                             My interests lie in harnessing scientific research to develop practical technology.

My scientific interests are in how resources, e.g., polymerase and ribosomes, are shared between genes during transcription and translation.                             The field of synthetic biology has relied heavily on high-throughput methods, especially plate-readers, for quantification of new biological components.                             My research is focused on the design of artificial modules and probing their applications in synthetic biology systems.                             My scientific interests focus on the interesting problems associated with simulating small, crowded environments.                             Most microorganisms favor glucose as their primary carbon source, as reflected in their genetic program hard-wired for this preference.                             The field of synthetic biology is leading to a revolution in the repurposing of microbes for various applications.                             My scientific interests are centered on the use of fabrication in synthetic biology to elucidate the effects that crowding and confinement have on biochemical and biophysical phenomena.                             I take an engineering approach to understand human chromatin and related diseases.                             My research has focused on functionalizing the surface of the model cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and in doing so, increasing the utility of this organism for academic and industrial use.                             My research focuses on furthering the applications of DNA strand-displacement reactions in molecular computers, sensing, and mechanical actuation for uses in new classes of circuits or materials.                             To make life better for E.\u00a0coli cells that overproduce toxic membrane proteins, I screened all known E.\u00a0coli genes for their ability to act as toxicity suppressors.                             I\u2019m interested in developing novel genetic switches to achieve gene expression manipulation accurately and spatiotemporally.                             The DNA-nuclear protein complex (called chromatin) \u201cturns the dials\u201d of gene expression.                             As a medical student, my research interests have taken a more translational approach.                             We tend to think of stochastic gene expression in the context of large controlling mechanisms in the cell, or active processes tied to replication and environmental response.                             The influence of spatial organization and the physical environment on the development and function of biological systems is a fascinating area of research.                             I aim to become a molecular programmer: a profession that, at this time, does not yet exist.                             I have long been interested in how robust, deterministic behavior emerges from the noisy world of random interactions.                             The Tan Lab is interested in understanding and tackling the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.                             My research is mainly focused on employing cutting-edge biotechnologies to environmental sciences.",

Most microorganisms favor glucose as their primary carbon source, as reflected in their genetic program hard-wired for this preference.                             The field of synthetic biology is leading to a revolution in the repurposing of microbes for various applications.                             My scientific interests are centered on the use of fabrication in synthetic biology to elucidate the effects that crowding and confinement have on biochemical and biophysical phenomena.                             I take an engineering approach to understand human chromatin and related diseases.                             My research has focused on functionalizing the surface of the model cyanobacteria, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and in doing so, increasing the utility of this organism for academic and industrial use.                             My research focuses on furthering the applications of DNA strand-displacement reactions in molecular computers, sensing, and mechanical actuation for uses in new classes of circuits or materials.                             To make life better for E.\u00a0coli cells that overproduce toxic membrane proteins, I screened all known E.\u00a0coli genes for their ability to act as toxicity suppressors.                             I\u2019m interested in developing novel genetic switches to achieve gene expression manipulation accurately and spatiotemporally.                             The DNA-nuclear protein complex (called chromatin) \u201cturns the dials\u201d of gene expression.                             As a medical student, my research interests have taken a more translational approach.                             We tend to think of stochastic gene expression in the context of large controlling mechanisms in the cell, or active processes tied to replication and environmental response.                             The influence of spatial organization and the physical environment on the development and function of biological systems is a fascinating area of research.                             I aim to become a molecular programmer: a profession that, at this time, does not yet exist.                             I have long been interested in how robust, deterministic behavior emerges from the noisy world of random interactions.                             The Tan Lab is interested in understanding and tackling the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.                             My research is mainly focused on employing cutting-edge biotechnologies to environmental sciences.",
